To inject your variation into existing songs, you'll need to put an empty ".txt" file here, with its name as your variation's name, and then add another ".txt" file with the same name to the same place, but through the _append folder, and fill that file with the song ids you want to inject your variation to separated by new lines.

## Example

```
bopeebo
fresh
dadbattle
```
