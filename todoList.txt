Future Plans:

Fix part in main README where I wrote about difficulty display name trimming
Replace the explanation about customizable song script in the main README with explanation on variation specific song scripts
REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE VERSION NUMBER AND ADD THE NEW EXTENSION TO THE GAMEBANANA PAGE!!!
Add stuff for the next update to the todo list
Try to use StringMaps more in the code (low priority)
