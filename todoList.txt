Future Plans:

Remove difficulty display name trimming and just let modders define difficulty display names themselves
Re-write the part of alt level data README which explains song additions
Add the ability to make variation specific song scripts
Add a simplified roses variation-specific script that just changes the red fade beat if the variation is "erect"
Move the customizable song scripts into a seperate mod and re-write their README to reflect this

Add the ability to make difficulty/variation specific level scripts (low priority)
