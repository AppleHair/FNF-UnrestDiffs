Future Plans:

Add the ability to make variation specific song scripts
- make them work in chart editor
- make the work in freeplay and story mode
Add a simplified roses variation-specific script that just changes the red fade beat if the variation is "erect"
Move the customizable song scripts into a seperate mod and re-write their README to reflect this
