Future Plans:

Add comments to everything I added in the code
Add TODO comments to code I should change if my PRs get accepted for the next FNF update
Fix part in main README where I wrote about difficulty display name trimming
Replace the explanation about customizable song script in the main README with explanation on variation specific song scripts
Add stuff for the next update to the todo list
Try to use StringMaps more in the code (low priority)
