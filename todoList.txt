Future Plans:

Try to use StringMaps more in the code (low priority)

I officially ran out of good ideas for stuff to add to this framework,
so I think I'm going to work on other projects for a while. I'll still
maintain this project, so if you find any bugs, feel free to report them
in this repository's issues tab. I'll try to fix them as soon as I can.
