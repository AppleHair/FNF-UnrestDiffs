Future Plans:

Finish comments on story-diffs
Add the ability to make variation specific song scripts
Add a simplified roses variation-specific script that just changes the red fade beat if the variation is "erect"
Move the customizable song scripts into a seperate mod
Add the ability to make variation specific level scripts (low priority)
