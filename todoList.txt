1.2.0:

Make the difficulty validator in DiffDefiner aware of the character selection in freeplay using the logic from the char-stuff branch plus and extra function to get the "player" name.
Fix all the other bugs and make sure everything is working as expected.
Update READMEs.
Mark variation injection as deprecated and give an example of how to do the same thing using JSON Patch in FNF 0.5.0.
Add download instructions to the main README and to the extension's README.
Add links to all the READMEs in the GameBanana Page and to the main README so they will be easier to find.

Future Plans:

Try to use StringMaps more in the code (low priority)

I officially ran out of good ideas for stuff to add to this framework,
so I think I'm going to work on other projects for a while. I'll still
maintain this project, so if you find any bugs, feel free to report them
in this repository's issues tab. I'll try to fix them as soon as I can.
I'll also be happy to review PRs if anyone has anything good to add to
this framework.
