Future Plans:

Add a simplified roses variation-specific script that just changes the red fade beat if the variation is "erect"
Move the customizable song scripts into a seperate mod and re-write their README to reflect this
Fix bug in story mode with difficulty bounding
Try to use StringMaps more in the code
Fix part in main README where I wrote about difficulty display name trimming
Add TODO comments to code I should change if my PRs get accepted for the next FNF update
Try to remember if there's anything else I wanted to change in this update
Add stuff for the next update to the todo list
